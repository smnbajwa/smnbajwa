Hi,
I am Saman and I am a Mechanical Engineer.

A while ago, I bought an Arduino kit and started working on electronics projects.
I was always interested in electronics and computer science. Therefore, Arduino projects
are perfect because I get to apply knowledge of different engineering disciplines.

I am working on a self-balancing bot using Arduino and I will post the progress here

Thanks for reading!
